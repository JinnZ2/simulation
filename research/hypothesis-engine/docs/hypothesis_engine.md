# Hypothesis Engine — Design Doc

An autonomous, **stdlib-only, deterministic** research pipeline for
`curly-octo-happiness`. It explores free scholarly APIs, stakes claims in the
repo's epistemic machinery, tests them by cross-source verification,
reformulates failures (with escape hatches), scans for hidden variables, and
consolidates surviving claims into hypothesis drafts. No LLM in the loop, so it
runs free on GitHub runners.

## Pipeline

```
                 config/topics.json
                        |
                        v
   +--------------------------------------------+
   | 1. EXPLORE   arXiv | Semantic Scholar | Crossref
   |     (urllib, timeouts, log-and-continue)   |
   +--------------------------------------------+
                        v
   | 2. LOG     data/findings_log.jsonl (dedup by hash)
   |          + EpisodicMemory append
                        v
   | 3. CLAIM   distill -> Claim(text, falsification, scope, reference_class)
   |            classify_falsifiability:
   |              unfalsifiable -----> data/unknown_journal.jsonl
   |              else ------------> DependencyTree (stake)
                        v
   | 4. TEST    cross-source corroboration/contradiction heuristics
   |            pass -> conf +0.1, fail -> conf -0.2
   |            persist data/claim_tree.json (reload next run)
                        v
   | 5. MODIFY  failed claims -> reformulate() (narrowed scope)
   |            reformulation_count >= 3 -> ESCAPE HATCH -> unknown journal
                        v
   | 6. HIDDEN  residual = |beta_confidence - 0.5| per topic
   |            trigger: mean|residual| >= 0.1 AND |pearson r| > 0.5
   |            -> data/hidden_variables.jsonl (hidden_variable_suggestion)
                        v
   | 7. CONSOLIDATE  hypotheses/<topic-slug>.md (regenerated each run)
   |                 + data/engine_report.md (stdout too)
   +--------------------------------------------+
```

## Stage mapping to repo philosophy

| Stage | Repo concept |
|---|---|
| 3. claim | **Claim staking** — every finding becomes a `Claim` with an explicit falsification condition, scope, and reference class before entering the tree. |
| 4. test | **Falsification-first testing** — with no world available, the engine uses cross-source verification as the test oracle: independent corroboration raises confidence, contradiction lowers it. |
| 5. modify | **Escape hatches** — failed claims are `reformulate()`d with narrower scope; at 3 reformulations the claim exits the tree into the unknown journal rather than being infinitely patched. |
| 3/5 | **Unknown journal** — unfalsifiable or escape-hatched content is preserved, flagged, never silently deleted. |
| 6. hidden | **Hidden-node detection** (mirrors `modules/hnd.py`) — residual series are correlated against exogenous candidate series; triggers on mean|residual| ≥ 0.1 and |r| > 0.5. |
| 2. log | **Episodic memory** — findings are appended to a persistent memory index (`data/episodic_memory.json`; repo `EpisodicMemory` used when importable). |

## Config reference (`config/topics.json`)

```json
{
  "topics": [
    {
      "name": "<human-readable topic name>",
      "queries": ["<query string 1>", "..."],
      "sources": ["arxiv", "semantic_scholar", "crossref"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `name` — used for scoping claims, hypothesis file slugs, and hidden-variable grouping.
- `queries` — each is sent to every listed source.
- `sources` — subset of `arxiv`, `semantic_scholar`, `crossref`.

**Adding a topic:** append an entry and commit; the next scheduled run picks it up.

## CLI

```
python scripts/hypothesis_engine.py [--config config/topics.json] [--dry-run] [--max-per-topic N]
```

- `--dry-run` — skips all network access and uses `scripts/sample_findings.json` (5 entries, 2 topics). Used by CI smoke tests.
- `--max-per-topic N` — caps results per query per source.

## Operational notes

- **Idempotency:** findings are deduplicated by a SHA-256 hash of
  `source|title|url`; re-running with the same findings changes nothing. The
  claim tree is persisted in `data/claim_tree.json` and reloaded each run.
- **Rate limits:** the engine sleeps 1s between API calls and caps results;
  Semantic Scholar is unauthenticated (100 req / 5 min shared). Failures are
  logged and the run continues.
- **Timeouts:** every network call goes through `_fetch()` with a 20s timeout.
- **Artifacts & commits:** the workflow uploads `data/` + `hypotheses/` as
  artifacts and commits them back with message
  `chore(engine): weekly research digest <date>`.
- **Issue on new hypotheses:** if `data/engine_report.md` contains the marker
  `NEW HYPOTHESIS` (≥3 surviving claims on a topic), the workflow opens an
  issue with the report body.

## Limitations

- **Heuristic claim extraction** — claims are template-distilled
  ("On topic {topic}, {title} reports: {first sentence of abstract}"), not
  semantically parsed. False positives are expected and handled by staking +
  testing rather than by better parsing.
- **No LLM in the loop** — fully deterministic; quality is bounded by keyword
  overlap, negation heuristics, and shallow numeric extraction.
- **Cross-source "testing" is weak evidence** — corroboration is not
  replication; hypothesis drafts are starting points for human review.
- Crossref/abstract availability varies; findings without abstracts produce
  thin claims that tend to route to the unknown journal.
