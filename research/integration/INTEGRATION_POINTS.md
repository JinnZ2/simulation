## The five repos and what each contributes

| Repo | Role in ecosystem | Key assets |
|---|---|---|

## Integration matrix (who plugs into whom, and how)

### IP-1 · CDT falsification_ledger ← everywhere
Every repo's claims should live in one ledger format. COH's Beta-posterior claim tracking, MCPM's verdict history, GBCB's hardware acceptance tests, and HE's consolidated hypotheses all map onto Claim→Prediction→Observation→Mismatch. **Concrete step**: adopt CDT's ledger as the serialization layer; add `.npy`/blob support via SHA-256 content-addressed manifests (notes/10 §2.3) so model checkpoints and WAV sweeps enter the chain.

### IP-2 · Subjective-logic opinions unify COH Beta posteriors and CDT confidence binding
COH tracks claims as Beta(1+passed, 1+failed); CDT binds confidence = reliability × warp(native). Jøsang's opinion ω=(b,d,u,a) is **exactly isomorphic** to Beta (b=r/(W+r+s), d=s/(W+r+s), u=W/(W+r+s), W=2). One object, two parameterizations → cross-repo interchange format; u drives CDT's gate; cumulative vs averaging fusion chosen by substrate dependence (notes/10 §1.5).

### IP-3 · Calibration gate ← GBCB hardware substrates
GBCB's verify loop (Farina sweeps, unit CSV) produces exactly the GROUND/PREDICT readings CDT's gate consumes: sensor = GROUND with reliability earned from its ledger track record (EigenTrust loop, CDT P0.3); the bond-graph model = PREDICT. The timestamped CSV contract (I1) is the wire format; `bounds=` DEFER handles incoherent reads (e.g., clamped phone-mic AGC).

### IP-4 · Covariance Intersection for dependent substrates
GBCB multi-sensor rigs and CDT's gate both currently assume independence (noisy-OR). Notes/10 §1.5: **CI is the correct fusion under unknown cross-correlation**; information-filter summation double-counts. Add CI as an optional fusion mode in CDT (pure Python, ~60 LOC); D-S conflict mass K feeds cascade audit signal S5 (coherence-under-contradiction) — the computed bridge from gate to audit (CDT P0.2).

### IP-5 · Cascade audit ← MCPM as a domain instantiation
MCPM's M(S) decomposition supplies h_eff and signal reads for CDT's CascadeAudit: A(alertness) from AR(1)/variance EWS (notes/07), diversity D as signal S6, drag ratio L/A > 1 as a COMMITTED proxy. Conversely, CDT's spinodal 2/√27 gives MCPM a principled threshold where it currently has verdict bands. **One shared example** (`mcpm_as_cascade_audit.py`) demonstrates both.

### IP-6 · Spinodal lineage closed loop
CDT's H_SPINODOAL descends from JinnZ2/JinnZ2 field_collapse.py and monoculture_collapse_predictor (Kramers escape). Eight atlas domains are cusp-structured (notes/08 Part B): each gets a reference h_eff mapper as a CDT example — the collapse repos become the *validated instantiations* of the portable kernel.

### IP-7 · Hypothesis engine ← all repos as topic sources
HE's config/topics.json gains: compression-order noncommutativity (notes/09 H4), manifold-aware quantization, Grassmannian distillation, CI-vs-noisy-OR overconfidence, per-layer ID rank budgets. Each consolidated hypothesis is filed as a CDT ledger claim with refutation_set + logical_form — HE becomes the cron front-end, CDT the persistence/epistemics back-end.

### IP-8 · Compression research program on the tiered stack (notes/09 + notes/10)
- **Tier 0 (stdlib core, new module candidates)**: quantization simulator (INT8/INT4/ternary integer emulation), power-iteration SVD ≤256², CKA/effective-rank battery, .npy reader/writer, content-addressed manifests. All fit the measured stdlib envelope (256² matmul ~1.5 s; CKA N=300 ~1.1 s).
- **Tier 2 (torch)**: the memo's research matrix (ResNet-18 + small decoder; INT8 PTQ / 4-bit GPTQ-style / structured / unstructured / low-rank arms; CKA + erank + Procrustes + mutual-kNN + TWO-NN geometry battery; Pareto atlas output).
- **Tier 3**: distilled int8 MLP → RP2040 via TFLM (≤~150K params, notes/10 §2.4) — end-to-end demo closing the loop from COH learning science to GBCB hardware.

### IP-9 · Geometry battery as a shared CDT example package
The notes/09 §2.7 battery (principal angles, linear CKA, whitened Procrustes, mutual-kNN, TWO-NN ID, R_M/D_M) is computable stdlib-only at probe scale → `cross_domain_toolkit/examples/representation_geometry/`. Reuses CDT's mapper pattern (series → [0,1] pressure), letting "geometric drift of a model under compression" become a cascade-audit signal (S1/S2 analog on representation space).

### IP-10 · Knowledge-system spine shared across repos
CDT P1 stack (content-addressed triple store, PROV-O emission, Belnap 4-valued labels, ATMS, Dung grounded extension, hitting-set repair) serves: COH (claim dependency graphs + hidden-variable tracing), MCPM (assumption provenance per verdict), HE (hypothesis lineage), GBCB (calibration provenance per unit CSV). One `integrate/` package, four consumers.

### IP-11 · Embedded telemetry back into ledgers
GBCB's serial_csv.py (I2) + MicroPython sensor nodes stream UART/CSV → CDT ledgers on the host. Hardware claims ("this coil meets spec across temperature") become continuously re-tested ledger entries — falsification as a living process, not a one-time check (notes/10 Tier 3 ↔ Tier 0 contract).

### IP-12 · Language discipline as ecosystem law
Tier 0 stdlib-only forever; numpy+pytest only in Tier 1 packages; torch only in Tier 2 experiments; formats (NDJSON/CSV/.npy/manifest) defined and tested in Tier 0, all tiers must round-trip in CI. ONNX for non-LLM models, GGUF only if local LLM inference enters scope. Mojo: watch at 1.0 (notes/10 §2.5).

## Suggested build order
1. **IP-1 + IP-2** (ledger + opinions interchange) — cheap, unblocks everything.
2. **IP-3 + IP-4** (gate hardware hookup + CI fusion) — makes the gate honest under dependence.
3. **IP-5 + IP-6** (MCPM/collapse instantiations) — validates the audit on real domain math.
4. **IP-8 Tier-0 modules + IP-9** (geometry battery) — new capability, stdlib-bounded.
5. **IP-7** (HE topics wired to ledger) — automation last, once the epistemic substrate is stable.
6. **IP-10 + IP-11** (knowledge spine, telemetry loop) — the long-horizon integration.
